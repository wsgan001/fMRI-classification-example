A demo of pattern classification with fMRI data. Reproduced from Poldrack's repository.
Copyright (C) 2017 Jing Wang

Data and toolboxes:
fMRI data, https://github.com/poldrack/fmri-classification-example
NIFTI, http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8797-tools-for-nifti-and-analyze-image
Libsvm, http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/ or https://github.com/cjlin1/libsvm

Usage:
Run FCE.m to play the demo. 

Software versions:
Matlab R2015b, released on September 3, 2015
NIFTI, updated on 22 Jan 2014
LIBSVM, updated on 22 Dec 2016 (3.22, the latest on Github)
fMRI data, updated on 10 Feb 2016 (the latest on Github)

Notes:
(1) 
You might manually download the data and toolboxes from the above links 
if FCE_download is not working.

(2) 
If the following error (or the like) occurs, please installl "a C++ 
compiler" first.  
    No supported SDK or compiler was found on this computer. 
    For a list of supported compilers, see

    Error: libsvm-master\matlab\make.m failed (line 13)
    Unable to complete successfully.
    => Please check README for detailed instructions.
After that, you could check the C++ compiler by the command "mex -setup c++" 
according to this page:
    https://cn.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/choose-c-or-c-compilers.html
Then run FCE again. It will output the following information if the compiler 
is Microsoft Visual C++ 2012, and you could get the classification results.
    uilding with 'Microsoft Visual C++ 2012 (C)'.
    MEX completed successfully.
