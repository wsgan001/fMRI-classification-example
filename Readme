A demo of pattern classification with fMRI data. Reproduced from Poldrack's repository.
Copyright (C) 2017 Jing Wang

Data and toolboxes:
fMRI data, https://github.com/poldrack/fmri-classification-example
NIFTI, http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8797-tools-for-nifti-and-analyze-image
Libsvm, http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/ or https://github.com/cjlin1/libsvm

Usage:
Run FCE.m to play the demo. 

Software versions:
Matlab, R2015b
NIFTI, updated 22 Jan 2014
LIBSVM, updated 22 Dec 2016 (3.22, the latest on Github)
fMRI data, updated 10 Feb 2016 (the latest on Github)

Notes:
(1) 
You might manually download the data and toolboxes from the above links 
if FCE_download is not working.

(2) 
If the following error (or the like) occurs, please installl "a C++ 
compiler" first.  
    No supported SDK or compiler was found on this computer. 
    For a list of supported compilers, see  
    http://www.mathworks.com/support/compilers/R2013b/win64.html  
    Error: libsvm-master\matlab\make.m failed (line 13)
    Unable to complete successfully.
    => Please check README for detailed instructions.
After that, you could check the C++ compiler by the command "mex -setup c++" 
according to this page:
    https://cn.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/choose-c-or-c-compilers.html
Then run FCE_prepare again, it will output the following information if the 
compiler is Microsoft Visual C++ 2012:
    uilding with 'Microsoft Visual C++ 2012 (C)'.
    MEX completed successfully.
    Building with 'Microsoft Visual C++ 2012 (C)'.
    MEX completed successfully.
    Building with 'Microsoft Visual C++ 2012'.
    MEX completed successfully.
    Building with 'Microsoft Visual C++ 2012'.
    MEX completed successfully.
Then you could run LIBSVM correctly.
